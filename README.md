# Webpack-typescript-starter

This repository is used as a template for webpack projects.
It allows for typescript code to be bundled in a minified version.
This starter also includes the [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin)
and an [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) loader.

## Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/philskat/webpack-typescript-starter <project-name>
```

afterwards install the dependencies running `npm install`.

## Commands

Run `npm run build` to build the app in an production version.

For development use the command `npm run dev` to run the webpack-dev-server.
This enables live-reload on the content.
